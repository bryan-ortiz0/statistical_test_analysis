# Executive Summary

Based on the data provided and the trends observed from 2017-2019, it is clear that the region that needs the most attention is the South considerating their participation rate being the highest out of all the regions, they scored the lowest in both the ACT and SAT. The data provided by census.gov in 2020 further demonstrates the disparity of resources across all regions, especially the South.
